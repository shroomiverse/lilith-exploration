# Contributing

Scope
This is an exploration-first repo. We welcome ideas, critiques, tiny experiments, and readable pseudocode.

How to contribute
1. Open an issue with a concrete question, idea, or mini-experiment result.
2. For pull requests, keep changes small and well-commented.
3. Prefer clarity over cleverness.

Whatâ€™s most helpful
- Plateau detection heuristics and signals
- Safe mutation operators (sensitivity-aware)
- Simple bandit policies that decide when/what to mutate
- Tiny benchmarks (even synthetic) showing when mutation helps
